## Day 1 Journal - Bought USDT with 500 pesos. Feeling stressed already, waiting for the market drop so I can join in.
### Day 1.1 Journal - I thought the market dropped since I saw 3 red candles but suddenly people started buying. I wish I wasn't scared and always in doubt of my self. Feeling disappointed.
### Day 1.2 Journal - All red candle it seems people are making it go down. I am waiting for the right time to get in.
### Day 1.3 Journal - It's very volatile, it's unpredictable. How are the pros doing it, how are they so good.
